## Deployment Instructions (Render)
1. Push your code to GitHub:
   git add .
   git commit -m "initial commit"
   git push

2. Create a file named runtime.txt:
   python-3.10.12

3. Ensure your requirements.txt includes:
   flask
   gunicorn

4. Go to Render → New → Web Service → Select GitHub → Choose ML_Project repo.

5. Use this Build Command (single line):
   pip install --upgrade pip ; pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

6. Start Command:
   gunicorn app:app
   (If your file name is different, adjust accordingly: gunicorn main:app etc.)

7. Deploy:
   Click “Clear build cache & deploy”.

## Environment Variables
If your app requires variables, add them inside:
Render → Settings → Environment Variables

## Troubleshooting
If you see:
“gunicorn: command not found”
→ Add gunicorn to requirements.txt

If deployment fails:
→ Ensure Python version is set using runtime.txt

If app does not open on PC:
→ Make sure you visit:
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Check errors in:
Render → Logs → Live Tail

## Conclusion
This repository (ML_Project) contains a fully working Flask application that runs locally on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ and is deployed on Render with proper production settings(URL https://student-exam-performance-indicator-9e0t.onrender.com).
